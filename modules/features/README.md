This directory contains the feature modules for Darts.

All feature modules should be prefixed with darts_ft_.

Please note that 'feature module' doesn't necessarily mean that the module is
managed by the Features module. It means that the module exposes a specific 
feature, instead of being a generic implementation of some functionality.
